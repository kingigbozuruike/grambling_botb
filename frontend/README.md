# Frontend Documentation for My MERN App

## Overview
This is the frontend part of the My MERN App, built using React. It communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD operations and display data to the user.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd my-mern-app/frontend
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```
npm start
```
This will start the React application and open it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production
